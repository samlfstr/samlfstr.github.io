    <p> Let me show you a proof of the first statement. It's due to the ancient Greek mathematician <code>Euclid</code>
        who lived
        around 350 BCE. Well suppose we've reached some stage n, so we've listed : </p>

    <div id="A"></div>

    <p> Can we find another prime to continue the list? If we can always find another prime, then
        the list goes on forever and we've shown that there are infinitely many primes. Well, can we? Well here's a
        clever trick that
     <code>Euclid</code> described in his famous book <i>Elements</i>, in 350 BC. Look at the number N defined as
        follows.</p>

    <div id="B"></div>
    
    <p>Clearly, <code class="greenish">N</code> is bigger than <code class="greenish">pn</code>, so if N happens to be prime, we've found a prime number bigger than pn, and we can
       continue the list. If N is not prime, then it's going to be divisible by a prime, say p.
       Now p can not be any of the primes, p1, p2, p3, up to pn. </p>
     <p>Because if you divide any of those primes into N, that prime will divide into this part and then as a remainder of 1. So p cannot be any of those, why? </p>
    <p>Let's take a simple example :</p>
    <div id="C"></div>
    <p>We know that if the resulting number exists it most have a prime factor which is <code class="greenish">2 and 11</code> and 11 is a prime bigger then 3 and 7. </p>
    <p>That means we found a prime number bigger than pn (last prime of the set N). Either way, if N is prime or if it's not prime, we've shown that there is a bigger prime than pn, which means the list can always be continued. And that proves that there were infinitely many primes. Let's just take another look at what we've done. We start with a list of all of the primes, or we try to list all of the primes. We have to show that we can do that and keep going. Okay, so we start with a list of the primes, we assume we've reached some stage n, n could be a ten, a million, a billion, a trillion, whatever. We reached some stage and we show that we can always find another prime bigger than the last one.</p>
